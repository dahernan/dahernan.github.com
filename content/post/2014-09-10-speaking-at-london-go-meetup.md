The Go London Meetup is the best place in London to learn Go and find gophers.
As part of the meetup [I gave a talk](http://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/events/203467502/) about Go's Testing Ecosystem.

You can get the code that I used for the examples, and the slides https://github.com/dahernan/gophertest

At the end more than a session about all testing ecosystem, was a kind of live coding session about how I use [Goconvey](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey) to do testing.
So it's a pitty that there is no video for the talk, because the slides and the code is not very representative.

I had good feedback, and the feeling of contribute back to the community.
