Last Saturday I was speaking in the [ScrumDay Oviedo](http://scrumdayoviedo.com/), just 30 km away from my home (Gijon) hehehe.
I was invited by [Raul Herranz](https://twitter.com/raul_herranz) and his company [Utopica Informatica](http://utopicainformatica.com/).

My talk title could be translated to "Five advices to improve doing Scrum" [(slides in Spanish)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J-Y63hUcuE8HgFFg195Qd2R5Z2dfclXoaDhU7_289fM),
despite talking about Scrum, the advices could be apply to any Agile practice.

[Antonio de la Torre](https://twitter.com/adelatorrefoss) did a good sketch to summarize the talk :)

Was a little bit difficult speak in Spanish, I dont't use the language for work since 6 years ago, so I don't know if some of the terms are translated or not, and it's not easy to find the right word.

The people asked a lot of questions about [Continuous Delivery](http://dahernan.github.io/2013/10/14/continuous-deployment-trends/), they were very interested about the topic.
At the end I was happy with the result, is good to contribute back is some way to your home community.

I spent the rest of the day as public, were I really enjoyed the talk by [Ang√©lica](https://twitter.com/alozalv)
and the care that [Javier Alonso](https://twitter.com/oyabun) puts in the design of the slides.

I usually try to mingle and meet new people in these kind of events but this time I was so happy to talk with old friends that I forgot that part for a bit.
Overall, a really nice experience that I hope I can repeat.
